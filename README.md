# Minds-Eye
Track, remember, perform daily errands and memory-boosting activities. Using Android Studio, XML, Java, UI design on Adobe XD.
This was my first attempt at using Adobe XD (Clearly!)

The user/patient would be able to keep a track of their daily activities and add tasks that they need to perform. Not only that they could also add their own other taska or their caregivers (family, nurses etc) could add tasks for them remotely.
